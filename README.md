# üîç Customer Churn Prediction

## Problem Statement
Customer churn represents a significant challenge for subscription-based businesses. Identifying customers likely to discontinue their service is crucial for implementing targeted retention strategies. This project focuses on developing a machine learning solution to predict customer churn in a telecommunications company.

## Why This Matters
- **Revenue Protection**: Retaining existing customers is 5-25x more cost-effective than acquiring new ones
- **Resource Optimization**: Allows targeted intervention for at-risk customers
- **Competitive Advantage**: Enables proactive customer experience improvement
- **Business Intelligence**: Provides insights into key factors driving customer dissatisfaction

## Data Insights

### Demographic Patterns

The analysis of subscription types across gender reveals:
- Male customers consistently outnumber female customers across all subscription types
- The highest subscription count for males is in the Premium category
- Basic plans show the lowest subscription counts for both genders
- Gender distribution remains consistent across subscription types with approximately a 60:40 male to female ratio

### Age and Tenure Analysis

Key findings about customer tenure patterns:
- Maximum tenure (approximately 60 months) is consistent across all age groups
- The 36-45 age group has the highest number of customers with maximum tenure (over 2000)
- Younger (18-25) and older (56-65) age groups have fewer customers reaching maximum tenure
- The data suggests middle-aged customers (36-45) form the most stable customer base

### Churn Rate Patterns

Age-based churn analysis reveals:
- U-shaped curve with lowest churn rates in the 36-45 age bracket (approximately 43%)
- Highest churn rates in the 56-65 age group (nearly 100%)
- Younger customers (18-25) show moderate churn rates (approximately 55%)
- The dramatic increase in churn after age 45 suggests targeted retention strategies are needed for older demographics

### Customer Interaction Impacts

The relationship between customer interactions and behavior shows:
- A critical threshold at 15 days since last interaction, after which:
  - Payment delays increase from ~12.6 days to ~13.4 days
  - Churn rates jump significantly from ~0.49 to ~0.66
- The data clearly demonstrates that customer engagement within 15-day windows is crucial for retention
- Both metrics remain relatively stable before and after the 15-day threshold, suggesting a clear decision point for customers

### Model Performance

Our prediction model demonstrates:
- High accuracy in identifying both churning and non-churning customers
- Predicted non-churn: 38,183 vs Actual non-churn: 38,063 (99.7% accuracy)
- Predicted churn: 49,984 vs Actual churn: 50,104 (99.8% accuracy)
- The balanced performance across both classes indicates robust model training with minimal bias

### Feature Distribution Analysis

The feature distribution analysis reveals:
- Most features show distinct patterns between churning and non-churning customers
- Contract length shows a clear relationship with churn (shorter contracts have higher churn)
- Age, tenure, and payment method are strong predictors of customer behavior
- Several features show bimodal distributions, indicating potential customer segments with different churn probabilities

### Gender and Tenure Relationship

Gender-based tenure analysis shows:
- Female customers consistently exhibit higher churn rates across all tenure periods
- Both genders show distinct patterns at approximately 10-month and 22-month tenure points
- Churn rates stabilize after ~25 months for both genders
- The gender gap in churn rates narrows slightly with increased tenure but never disappears

## Solution Approach
The solution employs a comprehensive approach combining data analysis and machine learning:

1. **Data Exploration & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and outliers
   - Performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights
   - Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables

2. **Model Development**
   - Implemented multiple classification algorithms (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression)
   - Conducted hyperparameter tuning through grid search
   - Addressed class imbalance using appropriate sampling techniques

3. **Evaluation Framework**
   - Used metrics beyond accuracy (F1-score, ROC-AUC, precision-recall)
   - Applied k-fold cross-validation for robust performance assessment

4. **Deployment Solution**

- Developed an interactive web application for real-time churn prediction
- The tool features:
  - User-friendly interface for inputting customer parameters
  - Clear visualization of churn probability
  - Risk categorization (High/Medium/Low)
  - Detailed explanation of contributing factors
  - Customizable analysis for different customer segments

## Results & Impact
The final model achieved:
- **85.7%** prediction accuracy
- **83.2%** F1-score
- **0.89** ROC-AUC

Key findings:
- Contract type, tenure, and monthly charges were the most significant predictors
- Customers with month-to-month contracts showed 3x higher churn rates
- Technical support utilization strongly correlated with customer retention
- The critical 15-day customer interaction threshold provides a clear intervention window
- Gender-based differences in churn behavior require targeted retention approaches

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Primary programming language
- **Pandas/NumPy**: Data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn**: Model implementation
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Visualization
- **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting implementation
- **Flask/Dash**: Web application development
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Front-end interface

## Future Work
