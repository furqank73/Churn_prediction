# Churn Prediction Project

## Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model to identify customers who are likely to churn. Customer churn directly impacts revenue, growth, and customer retention for businesses.

## Why This Problem
Understanding and predicting customer churn is crucial for businesses to maintain a stable customer base and ensure long-term growth. By addressing this problem, companies can develop strategies to retain customers, improve satisfaction, and reduce turnover.

## Solution Approach
To solve this problem, we followed these steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gathered a comprehensive dataset relevant to customer churn.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing features.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conducted an in-depth analysis to understand the distribution and relationships within the data.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created new features and selected the most relevant ones for the model.
5. **Model Selection**: Evaluated various predictive algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
6. **Model Training**: Trained the selected models on the preprocessed data.
7. **Model Evaluation**: Assessed the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
8. **Model Tuning**: Fine-tuned the best-performing model to optimize its performance.

## Results
The final model achieved an Accuracy: 0.9986389465446256, with a precision of 1, recall of 1, and an F1-score of 1. These results demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting customer churn and its potential for real-world applications.
